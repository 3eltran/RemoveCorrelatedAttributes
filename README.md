# RemoveCorrelatedAttributes
This program remove higlhy-correlated attributes fro a dataset. 


 To remove highly correlated descriptors the procedure was as follows: for each pair of descriptors, the Spearman's correlation coefficient $$\rho$$ was measured.  The pairs of descriptors with $$\rho$$ value greater than 0.98 were depurated by removing one of two descriptors.
